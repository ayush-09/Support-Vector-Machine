# Support-Vector-Machine
In machine learning, support-vector machines (SVMs, also support-vector networks) are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data for classification and regression analysis.<br>
<br>
In this SVM repository, I run both the classification and the regression model on the **movie.csv** dataset and kernel is **linear** for this problem.
<br>
### Movie Dataset 
## SVC (Support Vector Classifier):<br>
I choose the **movie_classification.csv** for the Support Vector classifier model.<br>
## SVR (Support Vector Regression): <br>
I choose **movie_regression.csv** for the Support Vector Regression model.<br><br>
**Both the csv are the same but in movie_classification.csv there is one extra column to check whether the movie is oscar winning or not.**
